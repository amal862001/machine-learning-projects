# Prediction of Subject Based on Question (NLP)

## Overview

This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict the subject category of a given question using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The aim is to automate the categorization process, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval in educational or customer support settings.


### Data Cleaning

Implemented comprehensive data cleaning procedures to ensure high-quality input for the model, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and text normalization.

### Feature Engineering

Extracted significant features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to effectively represent textual data.

### Model Development

Experimented with various classification algorithms.
Selected RandomForestClassifier based on its superior performance.
Achieved a training accuracy of 98% and testing accuracy of 87%.
Evaluation
Conducted rigorous model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning to enhance predictive performance.

### Results

The model demonstrated a high level of accuracy in predicting the subject category of questions.
Enabled better question routing, resource allocation, and personalized content delivery.
